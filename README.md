## About The Project
The CDC publishes extensive daily data on vaccine delivery, availability, and administration. From this, an approximate "excess" supply can be calculated at the state level for each state in the US. Further, from standard data on vaccine expirations, we can calculate excess supply which is at risk of expiring. What if we could donate the excess supply to needy countries? This would make good use of a sunk-cost as well as vaccinate more people globally, and reduce the risk of newer, more deadly variants which could harm us all.

How would we efficiently get the vaccines to the destinations given tight vaccine expiration timeframes? We can use commercial ariline networks! All data on airline networks and routes are public and we can create a graph from this.
